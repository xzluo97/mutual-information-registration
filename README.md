# Mutual information image registration

This library provides the [code](https://github.com/xzluo97/mutual-information-registration/blob/main/MI.py) for calculating mutual information between two (multimodal) images. The [lecture notes](https://github.com/xzluo97/mutual-information-registration/blob/main/MI_theory_and_examples.pdf) of an invited talk at the course *DATA630015: Medical Image Analysis (postgrad)* are included as a bonus.
